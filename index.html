        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I recently resigned from paid employment in the manufacturing field and have decided to take advantage of this opportunity to learn some new skills. I've been interested in learning to code for a while but just didn't have the time. I'm excited that now I do!</p>
        <p>While I'm not ready to commit to a new career goal, I'm exploring my options. Participating in the Treehouse Tech Degree program is one way of doing this. I'm grateful that the instruction is user-friendly.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>Whether just for fun or in preparation for a new line of work, I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
          <ul class="skills">
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Ruby</li>
            <li>Rails</li>
         </ul>
       <p>I’ve already created a simple <a href="http://www.jenhaga.me" class="website">website</a> using the skills I've learned so far through Treehouse. I would like to continue to make improvements to my site as I learn new skills. So far, I'm having a lot of fun!</p>
